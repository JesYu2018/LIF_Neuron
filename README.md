# STDP-Driven Motif Formation in Small Neuronal Circuits

This repository contains simulations and analyses related to how **spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)** and **input frequency asymmetries** jointly shape the formation of connectivity motifs in small neural networks composed of **leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)** neurons.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Synaptic plasticity is essential for shaping the structure and function of neural circuits. In this study, we investigate how STDP, in combination with asymmetries in external input activity, influences the emergence of specific **connectivity motifs**.

We explore:
- Two-neuron systems with bidirectional synapses
- Three-neuron circuits with all-to-all connectivity
